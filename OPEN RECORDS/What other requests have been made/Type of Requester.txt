Describe the Record(s) Requested:
A list of all descriptions for Open Records Requests submitted to the University from January 1st to December 31st, 2022. The goal of this request is to have a reasonably complete list of all the different Open Records Requests that the University has received. I am not at this time particularly interested in the Universities responses to these requests, the names or contact information of the requestors, or any other info like that. I basically just want a big long list of every other request. For example, If Someone asked for the same thing as this request but only for February 6th 2023, it would include the full text of these two paragraphs, but not your answer to it or anything else. That said I'm not opposed to getting other information like the names or contact info of the people who submitted these requests, or even your answers to those requests. I'm just trying to cut down on work for y'all. if it's easier to send extra info, go ahead and send it.
Be as specific as possible. Failure to provide specific information will result in the delay of fulfilling your request. Please provide all information you have concerning your request.
