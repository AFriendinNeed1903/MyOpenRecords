Posted in various dining locations associated with UT is a QR code which leads to this link: "https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e8TsmhsHEy2Pj8i" this Qualtrics survey is presumably administered by the University, and is thus under the purview of an Open Records Request. Please send me a record of all responses to this web form. I am looking for ALL responses to this web form which have been submitted. I am primarily interested in reading the comments, and ideally you will just send me paragraph after paragraph of the comments, spaced apart. That said, if it's easier for y'all to just scrape the full request and send it to me (with sensitive information redacted, but including data like level of satisfaction and location) that's fine by me. The goal of this request is to have a full acccounting of all responses to this specific web form: in the past I've requested "all responses to emails, web forms, etc", which I now understand is broad enough that things will slip through the cracks. Just this web form, please! if you have to set a cutoff or "end point" for when these request came from, please use 8am on February 16th 2023. But again: I'd like the full history of responses to this qualtrics form before that point, not just a specific year or something.
